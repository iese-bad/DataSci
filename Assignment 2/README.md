### Assignment 2

#### Introduction

This assignment is based on the homework of the lecture **Linear Regression**. Some issues on the analysis of the data from King County are commented there.

#### Tasks

1. Transformations, such the square root or the logarithm, are recommended in Statistics textbooks in many situations. In particular, the **log transformation** is recommended for variables with skewed distributions, to limit the influence of extreme values. Develop a model for predicting the price which is based on a linear regression equation that has the logarithm of the price on the left side. Do you get better predictions  with this model?

2. It can be argued that having a model based on a linear equation does not make sense on such a wide range of prices. Indeed, in order to cope with the expensive houses, we are spoiling the prediction for some of the nonexpensive houses. So, we could trim the data set, dropping the houses that exceed a certain threshold of price and/or size. What do you suggest?

3. The ZIP code has not been used in the analysis. How would you introduce it? Would it be more useful than the longitude and the latitude?

4. Time effects (trend/seasonality) have not been considered in the analysis. How would you explore that in the data?

5. Do you think that we are dealing with `yr_renovated` in the proper way?

#### Submission

Submit either an .R document with your code and short comments, or a full report in HTML, PDF or Word format, integrating the code, the R output and your comments.

#### Deadline

October 2 (Tuesday), 24:00.
