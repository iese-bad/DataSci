### Assignment 1

#### Introduction

The objective of this assignment is to get practice with some exploratory steps not covered in the example **Employees leaving prematurely**. The file `tata.csv` contains daily OCHL (Open/Close/High/Low) data for Tata Steel, from the National Stock Exchange in Mumbai, extracted from Yahoo Finance India. The dates go from 2003-01-01 to 2015-12-31.

#### Tasks

1. Some rows in the data set, corresponding to on-trading days, contains 'null' strings. Drop these rows.

2. Produce a statistical summary for the adjusted closing prices.

3. Calculate the daily returns and the logarithmic returns for the adjusted closing prices and compare them.

4. Plot a histogram of the returns. Can a normal distribution be used as a model here? Check this counting the number of instances captured in a 2-sigma interval (you should capture 95%, in an ideal world).

5. Produce a line plot for the returns, with the syntax `plot(returns, type='l')`.  

#### Submission

Submit the code used to develop your predictive model, with comments and a few conclusion lines at the end.

#### Deadline

September 26 (Tuesday), 24:00.
