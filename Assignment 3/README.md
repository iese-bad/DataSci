### Assignment 3

#### Introduction

This assignment is focused on **churn modeling**. It uses the Omicron data set. Assume that the Omicron management plans to offer a 20% **discount** to the customers that the model classifies as potential churners, and that this offer is going to have a 100% success, so the company will retain all the churners detected.

#### Tasks

1. Evaluate the **benefit** produced by this retention policy with the two models already developed in class.

2. Define an **R function** which gives the benefit in terms of the cutoff and find an **optimal cutoff** for this retention policy.

3. Develop a churn model based on a **decision tree** and compare this new model with those obtained previously.

#### Submission

Submit either an .R document with your code and short comments, or a full report in HTML, PDF or Word format, integrating the code, the R output and your comments.

#### Deadline

October 9 (Tuesday), 24:00.
